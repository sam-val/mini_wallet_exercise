[link]:https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8411283/SVfMSqA3?version=latest

Written in Django and Django REST Framework. I tried to follow the requirments as close as possible.

0. Install Python3

2. Clone this repo in a folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sam-val/mini_wallet_exercise.git
```
2. Outside of folder **mini_wallet_excercise**, create an virtual enviroment:
```
>>> python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate it
-  On Linux/Mac
```
>>> source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows (using cmd) 
```
>>> venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
4. Install the projects' dependencies:

That's it! The Server is running at <strong>localhost:8000</strong>
